## Overview
Urban Hunt is a school project made with the purpose of enabling users to discover new real estates, make appointments to see the real estate and buy/rent the available units. This was a group project with a lot of challenges, as this was the first time any of Us have worked with RESTful services and used Object Relational Mapping for the development of the database model. This is the first time we have seen spring security, and proper authorization and authentication of users by implementing JSON Web Token authorization with Bearer tokens.

## Technologies used
Main technologies which are used in this project are **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Spring Security** while on the frontend, the application was developed in **React with Typescript**.

For our database we opted for **MySQL** as this was a small school project.

## Our learning experiences on this project

This project was a big hurdle for all of the members of the development team. Seeing as most of the technologies we used, had not been covered by any curriculum so far. The most interesting part for us was to see first hand how Spring security works, as well as the efficiency when developing a backend application using ORMs, which helped us develop this project faster.

On the other hand, taking this many new technologies at the same time seemed like a lot at some points of the development. The amount of knowledge needed for grasping some of these concepts is a lot. Thankfully we managed to do it.

**We truly believe that this project helped us in the long run.**
